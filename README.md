# C CALENDAR GENERATOR WITH ZELLER'S ALGORITHM

"This C program generates and displays a calendar for a user-specified year. It uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to calculate the day of the week for January 1st of the given year. The program adjusts for leap 
years and formats the calendar with month names and day headers. Users can input any desired year, and the program will produce a neatly formatted calendar for that year. The code showcases fundamental C programming 
concepts, including input/output, loops, conditional statements, and array manipulation. It serves as a useful reference for calendar generation and can be easily integrated into other projects or applications."
